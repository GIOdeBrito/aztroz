# Aztroz
A small space game made in C with the SDL2 Library.
I've made some secret projects in the past in C. But this
is the one, or one of the ones, that I'll leave uploaded to Github.

## Requirements
- A Linux-running machine
- GNU C Compiler
- SDL2 Library

## Setting up
First one must have the the GNU C Compiler installed in its machine.
```bash
sudo apt install gcc
```

After that, install the SDL2 Library.
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

And SDL2 Image, for some reason they are separated.
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
```

## Build
Simply run the make command on the root directory.
```bash
make
```
